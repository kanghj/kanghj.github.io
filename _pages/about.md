Hello. I am working on my PhD at Singapore Management University! 
I am supervised by Prof. David Lo. 

Many aspects of Software Engineering interests me, but 
my primary interest is automated software engineering. 
My wish is to improve developer productivity reading and writing source code through the use of Machine Learning, data mining, and metaheuristic search techniques. 
I think the world will be a safer and better place if we have higher quality software, which can be enabled by better developer tools.

Please look forward to the papers that I will publish (hopefully soon).
