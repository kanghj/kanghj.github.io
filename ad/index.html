  <p>
  I am looking to hire Ph.D. students to join me at the University of Sydney.
  </p>
<p>
We work on software engineering research. We seek to have an impact on improving developer productivity. Our research will be driven by both empirical analysis and the development of an intuition feel of the problem space. 
</p>

  <p>
I am broadly interested in all things Software Engineering, but please take at look at my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I0aA7bQAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar profile</a> or <a href="https://dblp.org/pid/190/7414.html">DLBP</a> to check out specific research interests. I am open-minded about the qualities a student brings to a group. With that said, a good candidate for a Ph.D. student is <em>likely</em> one who possesses a number of these qualities:
  </p>
<ul>
<li> possess a deep curiosity and drive, with a history of favoring action over inaction,</li>
<li> is sufficiently proficient at programming to prototype and experiment with research ideas,</li>
<li> have a robust foundation in Computer Science,</li>
<li> enjoys insightful work and reading about the work done by others,</li>
<li> have an interest in communicating research findings to the research community, i.e., writing and presenting papers.</li>
  <li>The most important quality is a strong desire for self-improvement, with which the above qualities can be acquired! </li>
</ul>
  <p> 
    I have been fortunate to be advised by outstanding mentors, and I hope to pay it forward by being a great mentor to junior researchers and students. We will both challenge ourselves while working closely together. 
  </p>
    <p>
If you are interested in working together, please reach out! I look forward to understanding your interests. Please drop me an email and briefly describe a (engineering/coursework/research/anything really) project of yours that took a period of non-trivial, thoughtful effort. 
    </p>

    <p>
For any queries, please contact me at either hjkang.2018 [at] phdcs.smu.edu.sg or hjkang [at] cs.ucla.edu.
