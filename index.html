<p>Many aspects of Software Engineering interests me, but my primary interest is automated software engineering. 
Software is eating the world, and there is a coming <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/">software apocalypse</a> that we should try to prevent.
If we have better software, the world will be a safer place.
Better software can be built if there were better developer tools.
My goal is to help, improving developer productivity by taking best ideas from machine learning, data mining, and metaheuristic search techniques. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Mining specifications</strong>. My work so far has focused on mining rules and specifications about software. 
We have looked into better ways to mine automaton models of source code <a href="">[TOSEM 2020]</a>. 
These models represent sequential constraints/protocols of usage.
At the moment, I am also studying other representations of source code, as well as rules in less traditional software systems. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Program transformation</strong>. I am also very interested in program transformation.
We developed Coccinelle4J <a href="https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5488&context=sis_research">[ECOOP 2019]</a>, building on top of the Coccinelle program matching and transformation tool. 
  Coccinelle is unique in many ways and it is widely adopted in the Linux kernel and C systems software community. Key to Coccinelle's success is how it allows for the expression of constraints over control-flow. I think there are many lessons and insights we can take from Coccinelle to build better dev tools.
A lot of our work have been on the Android ecosystem, including studies on how to infer rules to migrate usages of deprecated API methods with their replacement methods [<a href="https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5827&context=sis_research">ICSME 2019</>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13220">ICPC 2020 ERA</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Representation of software</strong>. To better understand software, I am also interested in how best to represent a piece of program. 
For instance, in recent years, there has been growing interest in using techniques from machine learning, such as embedding entities into a low dimensional vector space.
In this area, we investigated the generalizability of a representative token-based embeddings <a href="http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/papers/ase19-code2vec.pdf">[ASE 2019]</a>,
and proposed embeddings for representing code changes <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05620.pdf">[ICSE 2020]</a>.
