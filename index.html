Software (+ AI) is eating the world but there is an incoming <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/">software apocalypse</a>.
We need better ways of understanding software systems.
My research aims to empower human developers by addressing important Software Engineering problems.
  To do so, we develop approriate task-relevant abstractions, and leverage human and domain knowledge.

    <p>
<strong>Active Learning and AI for Software Engineering</strong>.
    </p> 
    
   <p>
     My research primarily focuses on Active Learning for Software Engineering. 
     We have investigated the use of Active Learning for learning code patterns from human inputs and the large diversity of open-source programs [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09945">TSE 2022</a>],
     and improved the scalability of Active Learning by reducing human inspection and analysis effort [ICSE 2024].
     For <em>AI4SE</em>, we analyzed the generalizability of a representative code embedding model <a href="http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/papers/ase19-code2vec.pdf">[ASE 2019]</a>.
For making the results of static analyzers less noisy, we addressed methodological issues [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05982">ICSE 2022</a> (<a href="https://kanghj.github.io/publications/Poster_icse_how_far.pdf">Poster</a>)], and subsequently reestablished state-of-the-art results [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10012496">TSE 2023</a>]. We also used large language models for pruning false positives from static call graph analysis [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03230">FSE 2022</a>].
     
    </p>
           

    
    <p>
          <strong>Library and API usage</strong>. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Modern software development depend on third-party systems (e.g., libraries).
    We have built tools that have been deployed by our industrial partners. These tools:
    <ol>
    <li>employed large language models and a zero-shot approach to automatically identify the libraries described in NVD entries [<a href="https://kanghj.github.io/publications/xml_how_far_icpc_2022.pdf">ICPC 2022</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.03944.pdf">ICSE 2023</a>], </li>
    <li>classified code commits in the monitoring of open source repositories [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3540250.3558936">ICSE 2022</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13884">TSE 2023</a>], and </li>
    <li>generated test cases to ease the assessment of the impact and reachability of library vulnerabilities [<a href="https://kanghj.github.io/publications/issta2022_test_mimicry.pdf">ISSTA 2022</a>].</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

    
    <p>
      By exploiting human knowledge and refining a task-relevant abstraction of API pre-conditions, we fuzzed TensorFlow and PyTorch (<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29204">r</a><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TENSORFLOW-2841439">e</a><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TENSORFLOWCPU-2841417">s</a><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TENSORFLOWCPU-2841389">u</a><a href=" https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TENSORFLOW-2841463">l</a><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TENSORFLOWCPU-2841437">t</a><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TENSORFLOW-3026929">i</a><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TENSORFLOW-3026914">n</a><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TENSORFLOWGPU-3026809">g</a> <a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TENSORFLOW-3026820">i</a><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TENSORFLOWCPU-3026948">n</a> <a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TENSORFLOWGPU-3026805">o</a><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TENSORFLOWGPU-3026884">v</a><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TENSORFLOW-3136196">e</a><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TENSORFLOW-3136212">r</a> <a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TENSORFLOW-3136208">2</a><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TENSORFLOWCPU-3136242">0</a> <a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-UNMANAGED-TENSORFLOWTENSORFLOW-3136227">C</a><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TENSORFLOW-3136220">V</a><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-UNMANAGED-TENSORFLOWTENSORFLOW-3136255">E</a> <a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-UNMANAGED-TENSORFLOWTENSORFLOW-3136271">I</a><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-UNMANAGED-TENSORFLOWTENSORFLOW-3136279">D</a><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/security/advisory/tfsa-2022-170.md">s</a>) [under submission to <a href="https://kanghj.github.io/publications/skipfuzz_2023.pdf">TSE</a>].
    </p>

  <p>
<strong>Program transformation</strong>. 
  </p>
    <p>
We developed Coccinelle4J <a href="https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5488&context=sis_research">[ECOOP 2019]</a> for program transformation of Java programs, extending the Coccinelle program matching and transformation tool. 
  Coccinelle is widely adopted for the Linux kernel and C systems software. There are many lessons we can learn from Coccinelle.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Using Coccinelle4J, we have worked on the automated <em>migration of deprecated Android API methods</em>  [<a href="https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5827&context=sis_research">ICSME 2019</>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13220">ICPC 2020 
      ERA</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05020">EMSE 2022</a>]. 
    Other work include <em>machine learning on code changes & commits</em> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05620.pdf">[ICSE 2020</a>, <a href="https://kanghj.github.io/publications/hermes_saner_2022.pdf">SANER 2022]</a>
